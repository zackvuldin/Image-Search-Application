## Project Description

Search and browse a variety of images! I want the user to be able to enter in any keyword (Example: Fish) and it will pop up a variety of fish photos! Under the image it will have owner credit and download link. I'll call it...Vuldin Images!

## API Database Potentials, but didn't choose:

I spent so much time searching around the Repo for APIs and almost 90% of them were either too hard to use because it had to implement way more technologies than what I knew especially with my current time-frame. Even with all that time spent searching, I learned a lot about various of libraries and technologies. I think I spent at least 2-4 hours just reading documentation.

[Big ML](https://bigml.com/) - // 40min // No idea how to use the API. They want me to download or something along those lines?

Machine learning that mainly concentrates on decision trees.

[OpenCorporates](http://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/API-Reference) - // 15min // This API works, but kinda complicated on how to get company name out
OpenCorporates: Data on corporate entities and directors in many countries

[US National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/Data-Feeds/JSON-feed-changelog) - // 20min // I literally have no idea how this one works.

## API

I'm using pixabay's api. It is a RESTful API for searching and retrieving free images and videos under Pixabay. This API returns JSON-encoded objects.
The documentation has a lot of utilities to use.

**EXAMPLE OF API KEY BEING USED:**

```jSON
https://pixabay.com/api/?key=18550778-11774fb291f3a731ce9063d4e&q=yellow+flowers&image_type=photo
